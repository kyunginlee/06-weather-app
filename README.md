## **Project Description**

A weather app which enables the user to search a city and view current conditions, as well as view the forecast for the following five days. 
<br>

## **Functionality / Technologies Used**

All the rounds are generated before the game starts. For each round being generated, a random word is selected, which is then used to get 4 random synonyms, which are then finally used to get 1 random gif each. The gifs and the original word are then stored as an object and then added to an array. This process is repeated until all the questions have been generated, and once its done, will begin the game.

1) Openweather API
2) HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT

3) Save score by typing a username and clicking 'save'.

## **Future Development**

Continuous play - Looking to build capacity to continue rendering limitless rounds without predefined number of rounds to load prior to game start. 

Complexity - Ability to return rounds associated with a particular theme of interest and ability to vary the number of gifs returned

Multiplayer - Ability for players to contribute to a common leaderboard and set words to return corresponding content for other players
